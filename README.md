# CamlChess
By: Natan Aklilu, Daniel Botros, Francis Bahk, Young Zheng

This is the final group project for CS 3110: Functional Programming and Data Structures.
We implemented a terminal-based version of Chess in OCaml. This multiplayer game 
comes fully equipped with a realistic chess board, move history, graveyard, and 
even an optional AI opponent. The user interface is straight-forward and contains 
clear instructions.
